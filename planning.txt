HTML:
    -possibly a table for the grid 7 x 6
    -could represent a played piece by changing the id/class of the tr element and matching that with a corresponding CSS declaration to either create the circle or place in an image
    -top row should be buttons/could be a large selection, and target would be what you click

Functions that would be useful:

fillSquare

checkWinner
    -with an alert if there is one

checkIfEmpty
